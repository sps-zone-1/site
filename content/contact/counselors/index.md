# Assistant Zone Counselor 

**Natalie Rugg**, _Brown Unversity '21 (Sc.B Astrophysics)_

Contact: [natalie_rugg@brown.edu](mailto:natalie_rugg@brown.edu)

Hello, my name is Natalie Rugg! I am rising senior studying for a B.S. in Astrophysics at Brown University. I have been a coordinator for the Brown chapter of the Society of Physics Students for two years so far, and it has been the most fulfilling experience of my time in college. Physicists are passionate, curious, and kind, and I want to support them and see the community as a whole flourish. By providing resources and creating an inclusive social and academic community for my peers, I’ve learned valuable skills in communication, publicity, and allocating resources. In helping SPS National leadership plan the 2019 Physics Congress, I spent much of my time speaking with other chapters and gained a deeper understanding of the different issues that SPS chapters face.
